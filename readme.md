# forc / font-builder

![forc logo with the text 'forc' next to it on a blue background](docs/img/forc_logo.png)

forc (a terrible portmanteau of font and orc) is an emoji font creation tool. It takes in folders of codepoint-named images and a manifest file and returns highly-compatible emoji fonts that can work in a wide variety of platforms.

Making fonts can be really hard, so forc is designed to help you succeed every time - it has comprehensive documentation and guides on how to make your own emoji font, gives very readable and transparent error messages and is structured in a way that tries to make making highly-compatible emoji fonts as effortless as possible.

Because fonts are inconsistent and difficult, forc also tries to have a heavily documented and commented codebase, so all of the elements make as much sense as possible to someone new to TrueType/OpenType.

**Forc is under heavy development right now. Most font exports don't work quite right or are not functional yet.**
